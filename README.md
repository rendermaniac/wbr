# wbr

The acronym wbr stands for water bottle rocket software. This currently logs altitude based on a micro:bit connected to an enviro:bit sensor board.

Current features include:

* Automatic sequential file naming
* Abort option to cancel logging
* Altimeter Calibration step

Logging is determined by time delay rather than acting off a trigger.
